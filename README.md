##  Hi there
Hello and Welcome! I’m Kathy Kellogg, a multimedia designer at [SAIC](https://www.saic.com/what-we-do/mission-support/immersive-technologies). I support Mission Training Solutions at the Virginia Beach branch with graphic design, layout, audio editing, and light scripting in the development of interactive distance learning products. I’m currently enrolled in ODU’s Game Design program, in the Design and Writing track, to stay up-to-date on Serious Game trends in eLearning.
